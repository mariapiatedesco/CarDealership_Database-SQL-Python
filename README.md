## üöÄ Features

1. **Conceptual and Physical Design**
   - ER/EER diagrams for conceptual modeling.
   - Relational model in brief notation.
   - Physical design with usage map and optimizations (e.g., partitioning, indexing, denormalization).

2. **SQL Queries**
   - Parametric and non-parametric SQL queries for reporting, analytics, and transactional use cases.
   - MongoDB translations for specific queries.

3. **Interactive Dashboards**
   - Analyzes dealership performance by profit, sales, and rental volume across various dimensions (e.g., vehicle type, brand, and region).

4. **Python Program**
   - Handles client, employee, and manager interactions via terminal input.
   - Executes SQL queries dynamically based on user input.

5. **Web Application**
   - Implements client interaction with the database via a user-friendly interface.
   - Provides options to view dealership history, manage rentals and sales, and access analytics.
